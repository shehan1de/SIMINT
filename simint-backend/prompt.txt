- authors: String — Authors of the source report
- url: String — Source URL
- summary: String — Summary of the event
- sourceId: Integer — FK to Source
- typeId: Integer — FK to Type
- ideologyId: Integer — FK to Ideology
- tacticalActorId: Integer — FK to TacticalActor
- operationalTargetId: Integer — FK to OperationalTarget
- tacticId: Integer — FK to TacticMO
- locationId: Integer — FK to Location
- analystId: Integer — FK to Analyst

2.2. Source node — Represents the publication source.

2.7. TacticMO node — Method of attack.

2.8. Location node — Where the event took place.
- id: Integer
- country: String

Notes:
- Use CONTAINS with toLower() to match free-text fields like `authors`.
- Use ORDER BY e.date DESC and LIMIT 1 to get the latest crime.
- If the user asks "who committed", assume they mean TacticalActor.
- If they ask about "target of the crime", assume OperationalTarget.
- If they ask about "location", use Location.
- Always return readable aliases for output (e.g., RETURN t.name AS Suspect)

Example Commands and Corresponding Queries:

Q1: What are the locations where Tessa Flemming has committed crimes?
A1:
MATCH (e:Event)-[:OCCURRED_IN]->(l:Location)
WHERE toLower(e.authors) CONTAINS toLower("Tessa Flemming")
RETURN l.country AS country, l.commencement AS commencement
ORDER BY l.country

Q2: What is the Ideology of Paul Kirby's crime?
A2:
MATCH (e:Event)-[:HAS_IDEOLOGY]->(i:Ideology)
WHERE toLower(e.authors) CONTAINS toLower("Paul Kirby")
RETURN i.name AS Ideology

Q3: What is the country of the newest crime?
A3:
MATCH (e:Event)-[:OCCURRED_IN]->(l:Location)
ORDER BY e.date DESC
LIMIT 1
RETURN l.country AS Country

Q4: Who is the person who committed the latest crime?
A4:
MATCH (e:Event)-[:HAS_TACTICAL_ACTOR]->(t:TacticalActor)
ORDER BY e.date DESC
LIMIT 1
RETURN t.name AS Suspect

Q5: What tactic was used in the most recent crime?
A5:
MATCH (e:Event)-[:HAS_TACTIC_MO]->(t:TacticMO)
ORDER BY e.date DESC
LIMIT 1

Q: What tactics did Tessa Flemming use in his crime?
A:
MATCH (e:Event)-[:HAS_TACTIC_MO]->(t:TacticMO)
WHERE toLower(e.authors) CONTAINS toLower("Tessa Flemming")
